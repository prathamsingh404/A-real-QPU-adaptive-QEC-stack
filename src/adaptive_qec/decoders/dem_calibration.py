Detector Error Model (DEM) calibration and reweighting.

This module builds Stim DEM edge weights from *actual* hardware
calibration data rather than using static Stim-generated models.
When hardware noise drifts, the DEM must be re-calibrated to maintain
decoder optimality.

The key insight: MWPM is optimal for the *true* noise channel.
When using outdated DEM weights, MWPM degrades. By reweighting
the DEM from fresh calibration, we recover near-optimal decoding
without retraining the decoder.

Approach:
    1. Start with the Stim-generated DEM for the circuit topology.
    2. Extract per-edge error probabilities.
    3. Update edge weights using measured gate/readout errors.
    4. Rebuild the PyMatching Matching object with new weights.

This is the "reweighting" step that makes MWPM adaptive without
changing the decoder algorithm itself.
