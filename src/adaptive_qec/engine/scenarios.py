"""
Noise scenario factory for controlled ablation experiments.

Each scenario defines a temporal noise profile that can be applied
during an experiment to test controller behaviour under different
hardware conditions.  Scenarios use *real* calibration ranges from
IBM Heron processors, not arbitrary constants.

Scenarios:
    - Stationary: constant noise at calibrated values.
    - Linear drift: monotonic degradation of T1/T2.
    - Sinusoidal drift: periodic variation (diurnal cycle simulation).
    - Burst injection: sudden TLF-like noise events.
    - Multi-phase: concatenation of stable → drift → burst → recovery.

All parameters are drawn from measured IBM Heron ranges:
    T1 ∈ [80, 300] μs
    T2 ∈ [50, 200] μs
    CZ error ∈ [0.001, 0.015]
    Readout error ∈ [0.005, 0.03]
