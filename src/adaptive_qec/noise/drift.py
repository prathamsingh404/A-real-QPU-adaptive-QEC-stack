"""
Drift detection system.

Explicitly identifies:
    stable → drift detected → magnitude → affected qubits → affected parameters

Methods:
    Simple:  EWMA, CUSUM
    ML:      isolation forest, change-point detection (V1+)

A simple statistical detector beating a complicated model would itself be useful.
